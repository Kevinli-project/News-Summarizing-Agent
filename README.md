## What This Project Does

This is an AI-powered daily news summarizer for busy people.

It reads news across categories like **Top Headlines, Business, Technology, and Canada**, then:
- Summarizes articles based on your interests
- Keeps information neutral and high-level
- Explains **What Happened**, **Why This Matters**, and **How It Relates to Us**
- Lets you ask follow-up questions
- Links directly to original sources if you want to dive deeper

The goal is simple: understand what’s happening without spending all day reading the news.
